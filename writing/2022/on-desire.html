        <p>They say that not wanting something is as good as having it.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>But I have also heard that Wanting something bad enough is as good as having it.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>It appears as though it is the lukewarm wants that lie in between these two extremes that precisely cause suffering.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>While these wants are not strong enough to disturb the inertia of oneâ€™s life, they are not yet weak enough to be discarded.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>The result is a state of purgatory where one spends all of their time collecting more and more baggage without arriving anywhere.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>What does it mean to Want something bad enough?</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>One can only "Want something bad enough" once their desire is sincere.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>When one's desire is sincere, they become sufficiently serious.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>When one becomes sufficiently serious, they gain complete access to every possible resource at their disposal.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>When one has every possible resource at their disposal, what they Want is no longer a dream ... but an inevitability.</p>
