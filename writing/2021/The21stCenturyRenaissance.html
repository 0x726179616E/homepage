        <p>The human species is witnessing an unprecedented transformation. A new era for humanity is being ushered in by the advents of the Internet and Bitcoin. Respectively, these technologies have created an immense decentralizing force on information and wealth at a global scale. Power is being plucked straight from the hands of age-old institutions (governments, banks, universities, etc.) and being redistributed among individuals.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Just to illustrate this point, you can access virtually all of the information available to mankind with nothing but an entry level computer / smartphone (they currently cost ~$100), an internet connection (~$0 at your local coffee shop), and a resourceful attitude (~priceless). With the very same resources, you can set up a cryptocurrency wallet to store the entirety of your wealth in a math-backed currency of your choice and fully exit from your nation state's coercion-based financial system.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Once there are no longer limits on your access to education and money (which are often imposed by your state / geographic location), you can experience unimaginable levels of freedom and flexibility. Such a radical removal of restrictions will lead to an explosion of innovation and creativity that may very well bring us into a new Renaissance age. This time however, the "rebirth" of culture, art, philosophy, science, economics, and politics will be taking place on a digital (global) stage as opposed to the 14th century renaissance that was confined to Europe.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Throughout the coming decades we can expect to witness an emergence of many new polymaths and so called "Renaissance Men" (with the likes of Leonardo Da Vinci, Nikola Tesla, Howard Hughes, Elon Musk, Kanye West, etc.). This won't be due to some arbitrary change in our total supply of genius, but because of an entirely new system that is now geared towards the discovery and promotion of existing genius. The technology that we have today enables everyone to permissionlessly explore their talents, share with a universal audience, and prosper with sovereignty.</p>
