        <p>While this may be easy to take for granted in our modern over-socialized era, the fact that the human species learned how to intercommunicate with precision and efficiency was unprecedented in Nature. The creation of language was a pivotal evolutionary leap that humans took. This phenomena took on a life of its own as we began to grok the value of communication and so now we have a plethora of mediums that include oral storytelling, music, text, drawing/painting, plays, film, etc.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Of all the options for communication that language gave birth to, text is the most <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect" target="_blank">Lindy</a>. Which put simply, means that it's likely to stick around for a very long time because it already has been around for a very long time.  This becomes quite clear when you consider how much our other oral and visual mediums have changed throughout history. Traditional oral storytelling became podcasts. Hums and chants led to Beethoven which then led to dubstep. Theatre went from Shakespeare to black &amp; white films to 3D-IMAX movies with nine-figure budgets. We started off with cave paintings and then got the Mona Lisa and now we have memes exchanged over iMessage.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Text is the only medium that has proven to be immune to any of these wild mutations over the course of history. Yes, the formats through which we read / write have evolved (from stone etchings to papyrus scrolls to the printing press to digital screens) and lexicons do change over time, but as a whole, the experience associated with reading and writing has remained undeniably constant. Text may not be the densest nor the most entertaining method of sharing information, but it certainly is the most robust.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>If you have any message that you wish to pass the test of time and travel as far and wide as possible, your best bet would be to first write it down.</p>
